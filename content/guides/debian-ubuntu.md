# Quickstart on Debian or Ubuntu

This tutorial describes the steps needed to setup the ChirpStack stack
**including all requirements** on a single machine. It has been tested on
the following distributions (but with non or minimal modifications it will
work on other versions too):

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Debian 10 (Buster)

Please refer to the other install pages for more generic installation
instructions.

## Assumptions

Many configurations of these packages are possible. Dependent software packages
could be installed on any number of remote servers, and the packages themselves
could be on their own servers. However, in order to simplify the initial
installation, we will assume the following deployment architecture:

* All ChirpStack components and their dependencies will be installed on a single
  server instance.
* The [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](/gateway-bridge/) component will be
  installed on the server, but can also be installed on the gateway itself.
* No firewall rules are setup.

Of course, optimizations may need to be made depending on the performance of
your systems. You may opt to move the PostgreSQL database to another server.
Or you may decide to put your MQTT broker on a different system, or even use a
different server than the one recommended in this document. These and other
installation changes are beyond the scope of this document. However, you
should be able to find the information here that would make these changes
relatively straight-forward.

## Install dependencies

* **MQTT broker** - A publish/subscribe protocol that allows users to publish
  information under topics that others can subscribe to. A popular
  implementation of the MQTT protocol is [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).
* **Redis** - An in-memory database used to store relatively transient data.
* **PostgreSQL** - The long-term storage database used by the open source
  packages.

Use the package manager `apt` to install these dependencies:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients redis-server redis-tools postgresql 
{{< /highlight >}}

### Setup PostgreSQL databases and users

To enter the command line utility for PostgreSQL:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo -u postgres psql
{{< /highlight >}}

Inside this prompt, execute the following queries to set up the databases
that are used by the ChirpStack stack components. It is recommended to change the
usernames and passwords. Just remember to use these other values when updating
the `chirpstack-network-server.toml` and `chirpstack-application-server.toml` configuration files.
Since these two applications both use the same table to track database upgrades,
they must have separate databases.

{{<highlight sql>}}
-- set up the users and the passwords
-- (note that it is important to use single quotes and a semicolon at the end!)
create role chirpstack_as with login password 'dbpassword';
create role chirpstack_ns with login password 'dbpassword';

-- create the database for the servers
create database chirpstack_as with owner chirpstack_as;
create database chirpstack_ns with owner chirpstack_ns;

-- change to the ChirpStack Application Server database
\c chirpstack_as

-- enable the pq_trgm and hstore extensions
-- (this is needed to facilitate the search feature)
create extension pg_trgm;
-- (this is needed to store additional k/v meta-data)
create extension hstore;

-- exit psql
\q

## Setup ChirpStack software repository

ChirpStack provides a repository that is compatible with the
Ubuntu apt package system. First make sure that both `dirmngr` and
`apt-transport-https` are installed:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr
{{< /highlight >}}

Set up the key for this new repository:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1CE2AFD36DBCCA00
{{< /highlight >}}

Add the repository to the repository list by creating a new file:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo echo "deb https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/packages/3.x/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chirpstack.list
{{< /highlight >}}

Update the apt package cache:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt update
{{< /highlight >}}

## Install ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

**Note:** If you intend to run the [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](/gateway-bridge/)
only on gateway(s) themselves, you can skip this step.

Install the package using `apt`:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt install chirpstack-gateway-bridge
{{< /highlight >}}

The configuration file is located at `/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml`.
The default configuration is sufficient for this guide.

Start the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge service:

{{<highlight bash>}}
# start chirpstack-gateway-bridge
sudo systemctl start chirpstack-gateway-bridge

# start chirpstack-gateway-bridge on boot
sudo systemctl enable chirpstack-gateway-bridge
{{< /highlight >}}

## Installing the ChirpStack Network Server

Install the package using apt:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt install chirpstack-network-server
{{< /highlight >}}

The configuration file is located at `/etc/chirpstack-network-server/chirpstack-network-server.toml` and
must be updated to match the database and band configuration. See below
two examples for the EU868 and US915 band. For more information about all
the ChirpStack Network Server configuration options, see
[ChirpStack Network Server configuration](/network-server/install/config/).

After updating the configuration, you need to restart the ChirpStack Network Server and validate
that there are no errors.

Start the ChirpStack Network Server service:

{{<highlight bash>}}
# start chirpstack-network-server
sudo systemctl start chirpstack-network-server

# start chirpstack-network-server on boot
sudo systemctl enable chirpstack-network-server
{{< /highlight >}}

Print the ChirpStack Network Server log-output:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo journalctl -f -n 100 -u chirpstack-network-server
{{< /highlight >}}

### EU868 configuration example

{{<highlight toml>}}
[general]
log_level=4

[postgresql]
dsn="postgres://chirpstack_ns:dbpassword@localhost/chirpstack_ns?sslmode=disable"

[network_server]
net_id="000000"

  [network_server.band]
  name="EU_863_870"

  [[network_server.network_settings.extra_channels]]
  frequency=867100000
  min_dr=0
  max_dr=5

  [[network_server.network_settings.extra_channels]]

{{< /highlight >}}

### US915 configuration example sub-band 1 (125kHz channels 0 - 7 & 500kHz channel 64)

{{<highlight toml>}}
[general]
log_level=4

[postgresql]
dsn="postgres://chirpstack_ns:dbpassword@localhost/chirpstack_ns?sslmode=disable"

[network_server]
net_id="000000"

[network_server.band]
name="US_902_928"

[network_server.network_settings]
enabled_uplink_channels=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 64]
{{< /highlight >}}

### US915 configuration example sub-band 2 (125kHz channels 8 - 15 & 500kHz channel 65)

This is the same channel-plan as used by The Things Network.

{{<highlight toml>}}
[general]
log_level=4

[postgresql]
dsn="postgres://chirpstack_ns:dbpassword@localhost/chirpstack_ns?sslmode=disable"

[network_server]
net_id="000000"

[network_server.band]
name="US_902_928"

[network_server.network_settings]
enabled_uplink_channels=[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 65]
{{< /highlight >}}

## Installing ChirpStack Application Server

Install the package using apt:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo apt install chirpstack-application-server
{{< /highlight >}}

The configuration file is located at `/etc/chirpstack-application-server/chirpstack-application-server.toml` and
must be updated to match the database configuration. See below a configuration
example which matches the database which we have created in one of the previous steps.
For more information about the ChirpStack Application Server configuration options, see
[ChirpStack Application Server configuration](/application-server/install/config/).

{{<highlight toml>}}
[general]
log_level=4

[postgresql]
dsn="postgres://chirpstack_as:dbpassword@localhost/chirpstack_as?sslmode=disable"

  [application_server.external_api]
  jwt_secret="verysecret"
{{< /highlight >}}

**Note:** you **must** replace the `jwt_secret` with a secure secret!
You could use the command `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a random secret.

Start the ChirpStack Application Server service:

{{<highlight bash>}}
# start chirpstack-application-server
sudo systemctl start chirpstack-application-server

# start chirpstack-application-server on boot
sudo systemctl enable chirpstack-application-server
{{< /highlight >}}

Print the ChirpStack Application Server log-output:

{{<highlight bash>}}
sudo journalctl -f -n 100 -u chirpstack-application-server
{{< /highlight >}}

## Optional: install ChirpStack Gateway Bridge on the gateway

It is advised to run ChirpStack Gateway Bridge on each gateway itself, to enable a
secure connection between your gateways and your server.

As there are many types of gateways available, please refer to the
ChirpStack Gateway Bridge instructions for
[installing ChirpStack Gateway Bridge on the gateway](/gateway-bridge/gateway/).

## Setting up your first device

To setup your first device, please refer to the [First gateway and device]({{<relref "first-gateway-device.md">}})
guide.
